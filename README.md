# 📌 Shortest Path


This project is developed to find the shortest path between two points. The user defines nodes and edges in a graph structure. Then, using the Dijkstra algorithm, the shortest path and its total distance between two points are calculated.

#  What is Dijkstra Algorithm?

Dijkstra algorithm finds the shortest path from a starting point to all other points in a graph. It works based on distances and is commonly used in maps, navigation, and network analysis.
